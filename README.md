# CFW Installer
A PC app that installs homebrew on your Nintendo Switch. Plug the console into your computer with a USB cable, then put it into RCM mode by holding VOL + and PWR for a few seconds.

Run the program on your PC, and it will automatically install [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere), [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate), [NXDumpTool](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool), the [Homebrew App Store](https://github.com/fortheusers/hb-appstore), [JKSV](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSV), and [Lockpick_RCM](https://github.com/shchmue/Lockpick_RCM). Hold the PWR button on the Switch for 5 seconds to turn it off, and press any key on your PC to close the installer.
